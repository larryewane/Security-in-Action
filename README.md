## Adopting a control Baseline

External auditors have recommended that your organization adopt the ISO 27014 as a control baseline . You concur this recommendation.

Management's response is that they worry about the applicability and cost of implementing such a broad control set. What could you say to them to alleviate their concern 

## Response
First i will start by making my organization understand that control baseine serve as a starting point , as such the goal is to strategically align the controls with the needs of the organization thus it's unnecessary to impliment controls that our organization doesn't need 

The adoption process includes scoping (eliminating unwanted controls), tailoring (customizing and fine-tuning), compensation(substituting controls), and supplementing (adding controls, as warranted). Baseine can be phased in over time and in concert with budget allocation.
